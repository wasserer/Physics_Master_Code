# Physics_Master_Code
## Introduction:
This is a code collection for my master thesis. The use of it is to replace programs like Origin or Matlab, to treat and evaluate the data from Solar Simulator, XRD etc.
## Installation:
Just download it and run it. The file location needs to be manually adjusted.
## Functioning Modules:
Currently, the only functioning module is the "xrd_analyzer.py", which can read and plot the data measured, and compare it with the ".xy" data from vesta.
